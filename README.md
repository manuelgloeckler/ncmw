NCMW (Nasal community modeling workflow)
========================================

A metabolic modeling workflow for communities of organisms in an nasal
medium. This implements functionality to analyze the interaction of
metabolic models within a community.

► Getting started with NCMW
----------------------------

Please see the full documentation as a user manual at <https://manuelgloeckler.github.io/ncmw/>

Installation
------------

Please clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/manuelgloeckler/ncmw.git` . The package and all the dependencies can be installed via `pip`.
The only requirement that is not installed is some solver that can minimize quadratic objectives and is supported by Pycobra.

After having cloned the repository, please enter the following command in the same directory where the cloned repository is located:

```
pip install -e ncmw
```

This will install the python package `ncmw` but also console scripts `ncmw_setup`,
`ncmw_analysis`, `ncmw_community`, and `ncmw`, which calls the latter
three scripts in sequential order.

These scripts use [hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/), thus we can
overwrite all default values which are organized within `data/hydra`.
More on overwriting arguments in scripts\_

*NOTE:* Automatically adding scripts to the `PATH` may not work if the
python environment is not set up correctly. Alternatively you can call
the scripts by `python scripts/ncmw_setup`

These should be added to your `PATH` environment variable, to try if this worked use:

```
ncmw --help ncmw_setup --help ncmw_analysis --help ncmw_community
     --help
```

#### Trouble shooting

It might be necessary to have advanced user permissions because the
installation script may write into a central directory within your operating system.
If you receive an error during the installation procedure on a computer running macOS,
you may need to create an empty file `/usr/local/LICENSE` with write permissions by typing

```
sudo touch /usr/local/LICENSE
sudo chown $(whoami) /usr/local/LICENSE
```

Now rerun `pip install -e ncmw` and it should work. If not, please report your problem
via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/manuelgloeckler/ncmw/issues).

Overview
--------

The package is organised into five parts:

- **setup\_models**:
    which setup metabolic models to the given
    default configuration and medium, e.g., typically SNM3.
- **analysis**:
    which contains all function for single model analysis .
- **community**:
    which contains all code for community analysis
    and implemented community models.
- **visualization**: which contains all code to produce figures.

The **data** folder can be used to modify default values:

- **configs** contains the default settings for the maximum lower
        and upper bound of reactions, which is -1,000 and 1,000 mmol/gDW/h.
- **hydra** contains all default parameters for the scripts, which
        can be overwritten in the console.
- **medium** contains the default *SNM3 medium*.
- **models** contains all models that are used by the scripts.

You can change the default values if needed or add additional models to
the workflow.

Quick Start
-----------

### Scripts

The scripts will automatically produce some results, that is:

- **ncmw\_setup**:
- Will set the default bounds as specified in
      `data/configs`, as well as the medium as specified in
      `data/medium`.
- Will “gapfill” the model with reactions or the medium with
      metabolites, such that all models obtain growth on the
      specified medium

- **ncmw\_analysis**
- Will perform flux variability analysis and visualize
      results on all exchange reactions.
- Will analyze the uptake/secretion overlap between models
- Will compute the similarity of models, based on number
      of shared metabolites/reactions.
- Will compute the **COMPM medium**, which is the medium
      in which all models are able to obtain their maximal
      biomass rate.

- **ncmw\_community**
- Will create several kinds of community models.
- Will compute the **COOPM medium**, which is the smallest
      medium such that the community achieves 10% of the
      maximal biomass rate, which induces cooperation.
- Will visualize the observed interactions between models.
- Will investigate the dependence of community weight and
      observed growth.
